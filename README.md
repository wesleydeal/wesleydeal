# Hello

I'm Wesley Deal. I work at Fellowship Christian School as an IT Systems Engineer. We're a mostly Windows environment on the back end, so in between support requests I'm frequently working on PowerShell scripts to automate our procedures. I have a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology (concentration Cyber Operations Security; minor Computer Science) from Kennesaw State University as well as CompTIA Security+ and Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certs.
